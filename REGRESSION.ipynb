        "Identify predictors that are strongly correlated using a correlation matrix or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1️⃣ One-Hot Encoding (Dummy Variables)\n",
        "\n",
        "Converts each category into a binary variable (0 or 1).\n",

        "3️⃣ Ordinal Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to label encoding but explicitly respects the order of categories.\n",

        "Rating scales (Poor < Average < Good < Excellent)\n",

        "4️⃣ Frequency Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Replace each category with its frequency or proportion in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If “Red” appears 30% of the time, “Blue” 50%, “Green” 20%, then values become {0.3, 0.5, 0.2}.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful when there are many categories.\n",

        "5️⃣ Target Encoding (Mean Encoding)\n",
        "\n",
        "Replace each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If average house price in “Downtown” = 300k, “Suburb” = 200k, then categories become {300000, 200000}.\n",
